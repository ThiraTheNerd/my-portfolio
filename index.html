      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer, a blogger, a passionate millenial, a hardworking lady with a curious mind. I take 
        great pleasure in challanges. I am also an extrovert who enjoys a good talk. I'm a maverick, a 
        go getter and above all a kind and honest person.

      <h4>Moringa School</h4>
      <P class="description">My 2021 resolution was to perfect my coding skills and to advance my career and the best bet 
        in doing so was to join Moringa School. I have always been a creative mind and acquiring coding
        skills will help me to develop cutting edge technologies to not only improve my life and those
        around me but the global world as well. Also another reason for joining Moringa school is to have
        an independent mind. Acquiring the coding skills will help me to learn to not only wait to be 
        employed but to look at ways in which i can also be an employer and fend for myself and my family.
